## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a really difficult challenge, and I think I probably made it more difficult for myself than I needed to by trying to use utility classes at the outset and then confusing myself. I need to remember to develop top down until I get a better understanding. 


### Continued development

Areas that I need to continue working on are:

- Using different images on different screen sizes when its not as simple as doing a simple srcset swap.
- Keeping my code organised. This got out of hand with its disorganisation, and I lost track of what different parts were being used for.
